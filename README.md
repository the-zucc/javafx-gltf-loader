# JavaFX GLTF Loader
Tool to load GLTF models in Java. The early development phase is done,
and models are being loaded, though improperly.

## current state of things
All Sketchfab models tested so far worked wonderfully with the loader.
There are still a lot of use cases to cover, such as choosing the right
texCoord set (TEXCOORD_0/TEXCOORD_1) and other things.

## direction
I am working hard on the project, in order to make this an actually
robust and useable loader, and any help or suggestions from people
with greater expertise is greatly appreciated.
