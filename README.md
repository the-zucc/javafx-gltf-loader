# JavaFX GLTF Loader
Tool to load GLTF models in Java. The early development phase is done,
and models are being loaded, though improperly.

## current state of things
There are huge graphical glitches, but the models are able to be loaded,
and we can see something on the screen when running the test class!
Not bad, for a uni freshman's first 3D loader, huh?

## direction
I am working hard on the project, in order to make this an actually
useable loader, and any help or suggestions from people with greater
expertise is greatly appreciated.
