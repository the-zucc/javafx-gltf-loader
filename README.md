# JavaFX GLTF Loader
Tool to load GLTF models in Java. Currently in early development phase,
so testing is not possible yet. 

## current state of things
The structure of GLTF files has been mostly recreated in Java, with most
of the work on reading data from .gltf and .bin files has been done. The
ability to import models into a JavaFX scene, however, has yet to be
implemented. It is coming, however.

## direction
I am working hard on the project, in order to make this an actually
useable loader, and any help or suggestions from people with greater
expertise is greatly appreciated.
